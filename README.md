# booking-calendar

This is a calendar template purely in Javascript with the jquerry library and bootstrap for css plus some little html for the front end.

It has the following features:<br><br>
    -The booking amounts are calculated using a function inside the code. <br>
    -Dates that are fully booked cannot be selected/booked by the user. These days are set inside the code.<br>
    -From one month to another, it picks the dates selected/booked correctly leaving out the dates that are fully booked and puts these values inside of an array.<br>
    -From one year to the other, its also working fine.<br>
    -One can disable the date they want by entering it the disabled field.<br>
    -Finally, previous dates (less than today) are all disabled.<br>
    
It can be used in a booking site.
