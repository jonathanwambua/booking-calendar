# booking-calendar

This is a calendar template purely in Javascript with the jquerry library and bootstrap for css plus some little html for the front end.

It has the following features:
 -The booking amounts are calculated using a function inside the code.
 -Dates that are fully booked cannot be selected/booked by the user. These days are set inside the code.
 -From one month to another, it picks the dates selected/booked correctly leaving out the dates that are fully booked and puts these values inside of an array.
 -From one year to the other, its also working fine.
 -One can disable the date they want by entering it the disabled field.
 -Finally, previous dates (less than today) are all disabled.
